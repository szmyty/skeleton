# `PURPOSE.md` - Defining Project Intent & Direction  

## **📌 Purpose**  
The `PURPOSE.md` file establishes the **core mission, philosophy, and long-term vision** of the project.  
It is designed to:
- **Clearly define why the project exists** beyond just the code.  
- **Provide a guiding framework** for architectural decisions and contributions.  
- **Ensure the project evolves intentionally**, maintaining alignment with its mission.
