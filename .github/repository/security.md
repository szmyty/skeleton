# `SECURITY.md` - Security Policy & Vulnerability Reporting  

## **📌 Purpose**  
The `SECURITY.md` file defines **security guidelines and policies** for the repository.  
It helps maintainers and contributors:
- **Report security vulnerabilities responsibly**.
- **Follow security best practices** when contributing.
- **Understand how security updates are handled**.

📖 **Official Docs:**  
- [GitHub Security Best Practices](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security)  
- [GitHub Security Advisories](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories)  
- [OWASP Top 10 Security Risks](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/)

## **🛠 Key Features**
### **1️⃣ Supported Versions**  
Defines which versions receive **security updates** and which are no longer supported.  
```
| Version  | Supported         |
|----------|------------------|
| Latest   | ✅ Yes           |
| Older    | ❌ No (Upgrade Required) |
```  

### **2️⃣ Reporting a Vulnerability**  
Provides a **responsible disclosure process** to report security issues **privately**.  
```
To report a security vulnerability, please:
1. **Email us at** `security-contact@example.com`
2. **Or use GitHub Security Advisories**: [GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/advisories)
3. **Provide the following details**:
   - A **detailed description** of the vulnerability.
   - Steps to **reproduce** the issue.
   - Any **possible fixes** (if available).
```  

### **3️⃣ Best Practices for Secure Contributions**  
Outlines **secure coding guidelines** to prevent vulnerabilities.  
```
✔ **Avoid hardcoding secrets** (API keys, passwords).
✔ **Use secure dependencies** (`npm audit`, `pip-audit`, `snyk test`).
✔ **Sanitize user input** (to prevent XSS and SQL injection).
✔ **Follow the principle of least privilege** (restrict permissions where possible).
✔ **Review third-party dependencies** for known vulnerabilities.
```  

### **4️⃣ Security Scanning & Tools**  
Lists **automated tools** used to **detect security issues** (e.g., Dependabot, Snyk, Trivy, Gitleaks).  
```
🔍 We use the following tools to automate security checks:
- **Dependabot** → Automatic dependency updates.
- **Snyk** → Scans for vulnerabilities in dependencies.
- **Trivy** → Security scanning for containers.
- **Gitleaks** → Detects secrets in Git commits.

To run security scans manually:
```sh
npm audit fix  # For Node.js projects
pip-audit      # For Python projects
snyk test      # Run Snyk security scan
trivy fs .     # Scan entire repository
```

## **🛠 How to Use**
1. **Ensure `SECURITY.md` is placed in the `.github/` directory.**  
2. **Keep the `security-contact@example.com` updated** to ensure reports reach the right team.  
3. **Encourage all contributors to follow the best practices outlined.**  

---

## **✅ Best Practices**
✔ **Never expose sensitive data** (secrets, API keys) in Git commits.  
✔ **Always validate & sanitize user input** to prevent injection attacks.  
✔ **Use security scanning tools** to detect known vulnerabilities.  
✔ **Keep dependencies up-to-date** (e.g., `npm audit fix`, `pip-audit`).
