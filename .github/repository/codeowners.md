# `CODEOWNERS` - Defining Code Review Responsibility

## **üìå Purpose**
The `CODEOWNERS` file assigns **default reviewers** for pull requests by specifying **who is responsible for different parts of the repository**.  
This ensures:
- **Automatic code review assignments** based on ownership.
- **Consistent responsibility** over critical files.
- **Clear team-based accountability** in large projects.

## **üõ† How to Use**
1. **Place `CODEOWNERS` inside the `.github/` directory.**  
2. **To check ownership assignments**, create a PR and view the default reviewers.  
3. **If using GitHub teams, define them inside your organization first.**

## **‚úÖ Best Practices**
‚úî Use **teams instead of individuals** where possible.  
‚úî Assign **different teams to different code areas**.  
‚úî Regularly **update the file** as teams change.  
‚úî **Protect sensitive files** by restricting who owns them.
